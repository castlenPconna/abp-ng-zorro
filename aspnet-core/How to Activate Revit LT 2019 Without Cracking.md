Cracking software is a form of piracy that involves modifying or bypassing the license activation process of a software. This is illegal and unethical, as it violates the terms and conditions of the software developer and deprives them of their rightful revenue. Cracking software can also expose your computer to malware, viruses, and other security risks.
 
Therefore, the best way to activate Revit LT 2019 is to purchase a legitimate license from Autodesk, the developer of Revit LT 2019.

## How to Use Revit LT 2019 for Architectural Design and Documentation
 
Now that you have activated Revit LT 2019, you can start using it for your architectural design and documentation projects. Revit LT 2019 is a simplified version of Revit, which is a full-featured BIM software.

However, Revit LT 2019 still offers many powerful tools and features that can help you create high-quality 3D models, 2D drawings, and BIM data for your projects.
 
Here are some of the basic steps to use Revit LT 2019 for your architectural design and documentation:

1. Create a new project or open an existing one. You can choose from various templates and settings to suit your project type and preferences.
2. Use the ribbon tabs and panels to access the tools and commands you need. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts, the properties palette, the project browser, and the view controls to modify and manage your project.
3. Use the sketch tools to draw walls, floors, roofs, doors, windows, and other elements. You can also use the modify tools to edit, move, copy, rotate, align, mirror, array, and trim your elements.
4. Use the 3D view to see your model in three dimensions. You can also use the section view, elevation view, plan view, and other views to see your model from different perspectives.
5. Use the annotation tools to add dimensions, text, tags, symbols, notes, and other information to your drawings. You can also use the schedule tools to create tables that list the properties and quantities of your elements.
6. Use the sheet tools to create sheets that contain your views and annotations. You can also use the title block tools to add title blocks that contain project information and logos.
7. Use the print tools to print your sheets or export them as PDF files. You can also use the publish tools to upload your sheets to Autodesk Docs or BIM 360 Docs for cloud storage and collaboration.
